# DT_Wines_Asp.net_MVC
 This is an ASP.NET MVC Test practice of PROG1322 given by D.Stovell for managing wines and wine types. It implements a one-to-many relationship where a single wine belongs to only one wine type, but multiple wines can belong to the same type. The project includes validation, error handling, CRUD operations, sorting, filtering, and basic auditing.
